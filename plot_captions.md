# Figure Captions for C. elegans Embryonic Morphogenesis Demonstration Plots
*Updated for 6-figure demonstration series with temporal decline pattern analysis*

## Figure 1A: Dorsal Intercalation Left Side Co-clustering Heatmap
**Caption:** Time-resolved co-clustering probability matrix for left-side dorsal intercalating cells during C. elegans embryonic morphogenesis (220-255 minutes post-fertilization). The heatmap displays pairwise clustering probabilities between 10 left-side hypodermal cells as they undergo convergent extension movements across the dorsal midline. High probability values (red) indicate synchronized clustering behavior during the critical intercalation window (225-235 minutes), while low values (blue) represent periods of independent cell movement. Cell identities correspond to hyp1L through hyp7L lineages derived from ABa, ABp, and C founder blastomeres.

## Figure 1B: Dorsal Intercalation Right Side Co-clustering Heatmap  
**Caption:** Temporal co-clustering analysis of right-side dorsal intercalating cells during embryonic dorsal intercalation (220-255 minutes post-fertilization). This companion heatmap to Figure 1A shows the clustering dynamics of 10 right-side hypodermal cells (hyp1R-hyp7R) as they coordinate with left-side counterparts to form a single-row dorsal epithelium. The red-blue color scale represents clustering probability, with peak co-clustering activity occurring during the morphogenetic window when cells extend basolateral protrusions and intercalate across the midline.

## Figure 2: Dorsal Intercalating Cell Trajectories
**Caption:** Spatial trajectories of dorsal intercalating cells showing convergent extension movements during C. elegans embryonic morphogenesis. Individual cell paths are traced from initial bilateral positions to final intercalated arrangements, illustrating the characteristic "finger-like interdigitation" process. Trajectories demonstrate the coordinated migration of left (blue) and right (red) cell populations toward the dorsal midline, with arrows indicating direction of movement. The spatial coordinate system represents anterior-posterior (x-axis) and left-right (y-axis) embryonic axes.

## Figure 4: Temporal Decline Co-clustering Heatmap
**Caption:** Co-clustering probability matrix demonstrating temporal decline patterns during dorsal intercalation morphogenesis (220-255 minutes post-fertilization). The heatmap displays coordinated clustering behavior across 12 dorsal cells (C01-C12) with a characteristic temporal profile: uniform high probability clustering during the early morphogenetic window (225-240 minutes, shown in red), followed by systematic decline in clustering coordination (240-255 minutes, transitioning to blue). This pattern reflects the natural progression from active morphogenetic coordination to post-intercalation stabilization phases, illustrating how cellular behaviors become increasingly independent following successful dorsal closure.

## Figure 5: Intestinal Morphogenesis Velocity Field Analysis
**Caption:** Velocity field visualization of intestinal primordium cells during morphogenetic reorganization. Vector arrows indicate cellular velocities during the transition from internalized cell cluster to organized epithelial tube structure. Predominant negative Z-axis velocities reflect the characteristic inward movements associated with apical constriction and internalization processes. The analysis reveals coordinated cellular dynamics underlying left-right asymmetry establishment through LIN-12/Notch signaling and subsequent homotypic intercalation events.

## Figure 6A: Dorsal Intercalation Morphogenetic Feature Distribution
**Caption:** Quantitative analysis of morphogenetic features contributing to dorsal intercalation co-clustering behavior. The pie chart displays the relative importance of measurable cellular properties: Y-axis velocity (26%), cell elongation (21%), surface curvature (18%), and other geometrical features. Feature weights were derived from clustering correlation analysis, indicating that medial convergence velocity and cell shape changes are primary determinants of synchronized intercalation behavior during C. elegans dorsal morphogenesis.

## Figure 6B: Intestinal Morphogenesis Feature Distribution  
**Caption:** Feature distribution analysis for intestinal primordium co-clustering dynamics during C. elegans gut tube formation. The pie chart quantifies the contribution of distinct morphogenetic properties: Z-axis velocity (28%), apical surface area (24%), volume change (19%), and additional cellular parameters. These measurements reflect the predominance of internalization movements (negative Z-velocity) and apical domain reorganization in driving the coordinated cellular behaviors underlying intestinal tube morphogenesis from E-lineage clonal descendants.
